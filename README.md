# Games-Guy---2D

There are a LOT of changes now - best checking out the commit history for a full list!

2D RPG:
Tiled Maps integration - Supported - NPC additions (Orc, Skeleton and Signpost at the moment), Warp Points, Animated Tiles
Quest System (basic but in place)
Scene Management - warps take you to different scenes
Many more!


Original code and full credit to Robert Wells - http://thatgamesguy.co.uk/game-engine-dev/ as without those tutorials this file would not exist!
Quest implementation inspired by Javidx9 - https://onelonecoder.com/ , also a lot of my C++ knowledge came from his excellent tutorials. Do check them out!

Any questions, please ask - I am still a total noob so these additions and fixes are probably the worst way of doing things!! You have been warned, but maybe they will help someone?



LPC sprites GPL3 and CC-BY-SA3 - credit if you use any of them!
